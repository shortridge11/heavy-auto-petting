Things to know about Vue:
    Each .vue file has a specific layout ->
    <template>
        <div>
          <!-- inside this first div in the template there can be anything else, including 1000000 divs like below -->
          <div>div1</div>
          <div>div2</div>
          <div>div3</div>
          <div>....</div>
          <div>div1000000</div>
          <span>any tags are fine</span>
        </div>
    </template>
    Please note that there is a single div inside each template. There can only be one div in the template, everything else needs to be contained in that first div.
